00:00:00,111 --> 00:00:02,341
[i]Palestinian reporter[/i] ... The doctors were shocked that

2
00:00:02,365 --> 00:00:04,658
this woman's wound was bleeding,

3
00:00:04,714 --> 00:00:05,515
which meant

4
00:00:05,563 --> 00:00:07,325
that she was not able to get

5
00:00:07,452 --> 00:00:08,317
any treatment

6
00:00:08,405 --> 00:00:10,514
or medical support.

7
00:00:10,606 --> 00:00:11,638
They told me there are

8
00:00:11,662 --> 00:00:12,788
many similar cases.

9
00:00:12,811 --> 00:00:14,152
They told me about a woman

10
00:00:14,195 --> 00:00:15,875
whose arm was amputated.

11
00:00:15,940 --> 00:00:20,893
She had surgery on her arm.

12
00:00:21,084 --> 00:00:22,957
But, she was the only survivor

13
00:00:22,997 --> 00:00:24,512
from her family

14
00:00:24,552 --> 00:00:26,232
with her young daughter.

15
00:00:26,656 --> 00:00:28,722
So, she left Al-Shifa hospital,

16
00:00:28,751 --> 00:00:29,900
with one amputated arm,

17
00:00:29,940 --> 00:00:31,149
and the other arm

18
00:00:31,244 --> 00:00:32,514
holding her daughter.

19
00:00:32,643 --> 00:00:34,443
And when she reached here -

20
00:00:34,643 --> 00:00:35,923
[voice breaking]

21
00:00:36,397 --> 00:00:37,833
her situation was very dire.

22
00:00:37,925 --> 00:00:39,096
We witnessed today

23
00:00:39,121 --> 00:00:40,279
so many difficult injuries.

24
00:00:40,390 --> 00:00:41,271
We witnessed today

25
00:00:41,397 --> 00:00:42,690
so many difficult cases.

26
00:00:42,908 --> 00:00:45,304
The situation is getting worse

27
00:00:45,707 --> 00:00:47,387
in an indescribable way.

28
00:00:47,416 --> 00:00:51,361
Yes, we are talking about thousands of martyrs,

29
00:00:51,568 --> 00:00:52,925
But we are also talking about

30
00:00:52,941 --> 00:00:54,142
the numerous humanitarian cases.

31
00:00:54,238 --> 00:00:56,463
Entire families have made it to the south,

32
00:00:56,747 --> 00:00:58,477
Holding their wounded

33
00:00:58,605 --> 00:01:01,590
and amputated children and women

34
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:03,219
We have witnessed cases

35
00:01:03,243 --> 00:01:04,353
that are hard to describe.

36
00:01:04,395 --> 00:01:07,467
The doctors and medical teams were talking about

37
00:01:07,970 --> 00:01:09,650
very serious injuries.

38
00:01:10,662 --> 00:01:12,574
They talked about entire families suffering.

39
00:01:12,592 --> 00:01:17,028
We witnessed unbearable humanitarian cases

40
00:01:17,124 --> 00:01:18,724
today and yesterday.

41
00:01:18,897 --> 00:01:21,992
We witnessed the emptying of the hospitals

42
00:01:22,303 --> 00:01:23,644
of the wounded,

43
00:01:23,810 --> 00:01:25,490
of the martyrs' families

44
00:01:25,537 --> 00:01:26,980
who had to leave their childrens' corpses behind.

45
00:01:27,005 --> 00:01:28,685
An elderly man told us

46
00:01:28,702 --> 00:01:31,035
that he had to leave his daughter -

47
00:01:31,552 --> 00:01:31,980
wounded.

48
00:01:32,156 --> 00:01:34,756
He does not know if she made it or not.

49
00:01:35,248 --> 00:01:39,228
But he had to save the rest of his family

50
00:01:39,276 --> 00:01:40,323
and leave the hospital.

51
00:01:40,398 --> 00:01:42,342
He had to choose to sacrifice one daughter,

52
00:01:42,484 --> 00:01:45,351
so he does not sacrifice his entire family.

53
00:01:45,521 --> 00:01:47,468
This is what the humanitarian situation

54
00:01:47,524 --> 00:01:48,428
has become now in Gaza.

55
00:01:48,481 --> 00:01:50,296
This is what the scene has become in Gaza.

56
00:01:50,344 --> 00:01:53,144
This is what the entire world

57
00:01:53,516 --> 00:01:54,516
is watching.

58
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:57,457
All that we can say now,

59
00:01:57,827 --> 00:01:58,906
when talking about

60
00:01:58,944 --> 00:02:00,224
the situation

61
00:02:00,497 --> 00:02:02,088
in Al-Shifa hospital,

62
00:02:02,146 --> 00:02:03,677
is that there is constant bombardment,

63
00:02:03,725 --> 00:02:05,859
and the medical teams

64
00:02:06,103 --> 00:02:09,507
are trying to support the patients

65
00:02:09,579 --> 00:02:11,730
and the displaced,

66
00:02:11,944 --> 00:02:14,344
and how they feel the responsibility to keep working

67
00:02:14,373 --> 00:02:17,040
inside the hospital, despite everything.
