1
00:00:00,148 --> 00:00:03,273
[i]Ta-nehisi Coates:[/i] You can't behold evil,

2
00:00:04,289 --> 00:00:06,689
and then return and not speak on it.

3
00:00:07,042 --> 00:00:09,484
And, segregation is evil.

4
00:00:10,316 --> 00:00:12,593
There just is no, there is no way for me,

5
00:00:12,603 --> 00:00:14,283
as an African American,

6
00:00:14,787 --> 00:00:16,712
to come back, and stand before you,

7
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:18,498
to witness segregation,

8
00:00:18,648 --> 00:00:20,648
and not say anything about it.

9
00:00:20,852 --> 00:00:22,585
One of the hardest things,

10
00:00:23,020 --> 00:00:24,020
ah...

11
00:00:26,067 --> 00:00:27,427
was to come back,

12
00:00:27,615 --> 00:00:29,288
and then to read the rhetoric

13
00:00:29,336 --> 00:00:32,002
of certain African American politicians,

14
00:00:32,228 --> 00:00:34,719
who... are defending this regime!

15
00:00:35,201 --> 00:00:38,145
And I just - I - I - I couldn't understand it!

16
00:00:38,689 --> 00:00:40,897
You know - I wanted to know if they had been to Hebron!

17
00:00:41,466 --> 00:00:42,989
You know - I - I wanted to know,

18
00:00:43,032 --> 00:00:44,532
if they had been to Masafer Yatta,

19
00:00:44,549 --> 00:00:45,600
If they had been to Susiya,

20
00:00:45,632 --> 00:00:46,602
if they had been to Tuba,

21
00:00:46,657 --> 00:00:47,969
had - had they seen!?

22
00:00:48,247 --> 00:00:49,927
Had they really seen,

23
00:00:50,314 --> 00:00:51,735
what is actually

24
00:00:52,078 --> 00:00:53,278
happening here?

25
00:00:53,685 --> 00:00:56,367
I - I - I don't know how anybody

26
00:00:56,797 --> 00:00:58,720
who benefits, who stands on the shoulders

27
00:00:58,726 --> 00:01:00,132
of our ancestors' struggle,

28
00:01:00,178 --> 00:01:01,404
against Jim Crow,

29
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:03,200
against segregation,

30
00:01:03,470 --> 00:01:05,390
could see what is happening right now -

31
00:01:05,408 --> 00:01:07,071
could see the bombs being dropped,

32
00:01:07,124 --> 00:01:09,381
nine thousand people dead,

33
00:01:09,610 --> 00:01:11,844
an ungodly number of them, children,

34
00:01:11,895 --> 00:01:13,856
in service of Jim Crow,

35
00:01:13,899 --> 00:01:14,647
and segregation -

36
00:01:14,655 --> 00:01:16,335
which we have exported -

37
00:01:16,971 --> 00:01:18,651
and be okay with that.

38
00:01:18,797 --> 00:01:20,484
I - I don't - I don't understand.

39
00:01:20,531 --> 00:01:22,606
So yes, I have my fears, I do, I do.

40
00:01:22,631 --> 00:01:23,605
You know, I'm afraid right now,

41
00:01:23,629 --> 00:01:25,495
sitting here talking to you.

42
00:01:25,523 --> 00:01:27,878
but I have to measure my fear,

43
00:01:28,268 --> 00:01:29,788
against the misery,

44
00:01:29,907 --> 00:01:30,686
that I saw.

45
00:01:30,718 --> 00:01:31,359
I have to measure my fear

46
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:32,960
against the promises

47
00:01:33,073 --> 00:01:34,073
that I made,

48
00:01:34,207 --> 00:01:36,019
to the Palestinians who welcomed me

49
00:01:36,139 --> 00:01:36,951
into their homes

50
00:01:36,975 --> 00:01:37,732
and gave me the facts.

51
00:01:37,756 --> 00:01:39,276
To the Israeli Jews

52
00:01:39,349 --> 00:01:41,333
who welcomed me into their homes,

53
00:01:41,389 --> 00:01:42,245
and gave me the facts.

54
00:01:42,270 --> 00:01:44,003
To the Holocaust survivors

55
00:01:44,374 --> 00:01:46,076
who welcomed me into their homes,

56
00:01:46,099 --> 00:01:47,466
and gave me the facts.

57
00:01:47,494 --> 00:01:50,189
I have to measure it against my own ancestors,

58
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:51,581
against Fredrick Douglass,

59
00:01:51,644 --> 00:01:53,324
against Ida B. Wells,

60
00:01:53,559 --> 00:01:55,481
who certainly faced off against things

61
00:01:55,498 --> 00:01:57,421
that were much, much more perilous

62
00:01:57,523 --> 00:01:58,194
than...

63
00:01:58,510 --> 00:01:59,870
going someplace,

64
00:02:00,413 --> 00:02:01,042
coming back

65
00:02:01,051 --> 00:02:02,844
and telling people what you saw.

66
00:02:02,868 --> 00:02:04,468
This is the minimum!

67
00:02:04,634 --> 00:02:05,673
It’s scary,

68
00:02:05,993 --> 00:02:07,483
but it’s also the minimum.

69
00:02:07,515 --> 00:02:09,973
And the fact that people are trying to suppress...

70
00:02:10,005 --> 00:02:10,991
speech..

71
00:02:11,015 --> 00:02:13,548
is not an excuse for you not to speak.

72
00:02:14,023 --> 00:02:16,157
It’s always been this way for black writers and journalists.

73
00:02:16,182 --> 00:02:17,553
This is our tradition, you know?

74
00:02:18,141 --> 00:02:20,609
And so, I feel — as I do feel the fear,

75
00:02:20,625 --> 00:02:22,921
 I also feel that I am in good company,

76
00:02:22,945 --> 00:02:25,812
because I’m in the company of my ancestors.
