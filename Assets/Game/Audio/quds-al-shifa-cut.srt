1
00:00:03,802 --> 00:00:05,984
[i]Palestinian reporter:[/i] This is how things looks inside

2
00:00:06,024 --> 00:00:08,968
the emergency department at Al-Shifa hospital.

3
00:00:09,131 --> 00:00:12,468
The department is full of the injured.

4
00:00:12,571 --> 00:00:15,471
Here, we enter the critical cases department.

5
00:00:15,727 --> 00:00:18,095
The patients are too much that

6
00:00:18,182 --> 00:00:22,517
they are being treated on the floor.

7
00:00:22,653 --> 00:00:28,636
They are dying because of the collapse of the health care system,

8
00:00:28,715 --> 00:00:31,335
the lack of medicine,

9
00:00:31,731 --> 00:00:36,016
and Israel's siege on hospitals.

10
00:00:37,429 --> 00:00:40,516
The scene is too horrible to describe.

11
00:00:41,246 --> 00:00:45,929
The injured of Gaza are left alone by the world

12
00:00:45,937 --> 00:00:50,056
facing Israel's bombardment of hospitals.

13
00:00:51,404 --> 00:00:55,191
The medical staff were also martyred,

14
00:00:55,770 --> 00:00:56,834
injured,

15
00:00:56,930 --> 00:00:58,548
and displaced.

16
00:00:58,758 --> 00:01:01,409
It's not clean here,

17
00:01:01,663 --> 00:01:04,440
the floor is full of blood.

18
00:01:07,533 --> 00:01:10,771
Medical crews are helpless

19
00:01:12,985 --> 00:01:15,929
because of the massive number of the injuries.

20
00:01:20,158 --> 00:01:30,401
This child has died because of the lack of healthcare.

21
00:01:31,060 --> 00:01:35,306
His brother is probably dying

22
00:01:38,172 --> 00:01:41,163
The man is putting the child who was killed

23
00:01:41,196 --> 00:01:44,096
in the bombardment of the outpatient clinics

24
00:01:44,177 --> 00:01:47,454
in Al-Shifa hospital next to his brother.

25
00:01:49,573 --> 00:01:51,850
This is how it looks here.

26
00:01:52,708 --> 00:01:54,992
Even the hospitals have been bombed.

27
00:01:55,112 --> 00:01:56,976
The displaced children who thought

28
00:01:57,408 --> 00:01:59,548
that hospitals are save were killed

29
00:01:59,573 --> 00:02:01,159
inside the hospitals.

30
00:02:01,259 --> 00:02:05,385
Dead bodies remain on the floor.

31
00:02:05,990 --> 00:02:08,227
Journalists left the hospital

32
00:02:09,038 --> 00:02:11,267
because of the hard situation and insecurity.

33
00:02:14,812 --> 00:02:18,553
The courtyard was bombed too

34
00:02:18,727 --> 00:02:21,188
by the Israeli occupation

35
00:02:22,380 --> 00:02:24,903
The treatment here is barbaric and inhuma.

36
00:02:24,996 --> 00:02:27,396
This has never happened in any time.

37
00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:42,033
I don't think anyone has dared to target hospitals, clinics

38
00:02:42,939 --> 00:02:45,571
or children blood,

39
00:02:47,976 --> 00:02:50,920
except those who are internationally supported

40
00:02:54,063 --> 00:02:59,396
and use the excuse of "self defense" to kill children
