1
00:00:02,796 --> 00:00:06,080
We sought refuge here thinking it was a safe haven.

2
00:00:08,383 --> 00:00:09,703
Our last safe haven,

3
00:00:11,484 --> 00:00:12,601
 in a church.

4
00:00:14,055 --> 00:00:15,415
The house of God.

5
00:00:17,461 --> 00:00:18,564
Those are...

6
00:00:20,639 --> 00:00:22,159
My three children.

7
00:00:23,448 --> 00:00:32,224
I lost them to the Israeli aggression against Gaza

8
00:00:32,750 --> 00:00:35,190
During the air strike to the Church of Saint Porphyrius.

9
00:00:36,654 --> 00:00:39,475
Suhail Ramez El Soury,

10
00:00:41,281 --> 00:00:42,961
Jouly Ramez El Soury,

11
00:00:43,963 --> 00:00:45,716
Majd Ramez El Soury,

12
00:00:47,902 --> 00:00:51,773
This is the place that was bombed.

13
00:00:55,215 --> 00:00:57,741
It was an all-civilian place.

14
00:00:59,224 --> 00:01:02,089
It had nothing to do with the military.

15
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:08,074
This photo was taken during Palm Sunday.

16
00:01:08,803 --> 00:01:13,594
This is Majd, my little bird. Look at him.

17
00:01:13,812 --> 00:01:14,932
He was a child.

18
00:01:16,718 --> 00:01:18,457
He became disfigured.

19
00:01:18,700 --> 00:01:21,848
He became dead and disfigured.

20
00:01:23,053 --> 00:01:25,283
His stomach was burned and had shrapnel.

21
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:27,538
My daughter Sima as well.

22
00:01:29,405 --> 00:01:31,085
Her head was crushed.

23
00:01:32,446 --> 00:01:34,112
She was disfigured. My daughter Sima.

24
00:01:37,987 --> 00:01:44,593
I myself pulled Suhail's body from the rubble.

25
00:01:45,070 --> 00:01:53,042
He was hit in his head and feet, which were almost cut off.

26
00:01:56,135 --> 00:01:59,001
Sima is now a beautiful bride next to God.

27
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:03,030
She is... She was an angel.

28
00:02:06,459 --> 00:02:07,459
An angel.

29
00:02:09,001 --> 00:02:12,179
She is an angel. She is an angel.

30
00:02:12,891 --> 00:02:15,744
Do they bomb angels?

31
00:02:17,426 --> 00:02:23,150
They bombed my angels and killed them without warning.

32
00:02:23,793 --> 00:02:28,393
They killed our children, the children of cousins and relatives.

33
00:02:35,436 --> 00:02:38,352
[Crying]

34
00:02:56,547 --> 00:03:00,668
This is what they targeted. This was our shelter.

35
00:03:01,354 --> 00:03:02,954
This was our church.

36
00:03:04,646 --> 00:03:06,069
This was the entrance.

37
00:03:06,563 --> 00:03:10,572
We used to enter from here to pray to celebrate our joy.

38
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:18,265
Stay Strong.

39
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:21,653
They took my children from me.
