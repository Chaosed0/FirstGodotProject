00:00:02,796 --> 00:00:04,023
[i]Palestinian man:[/i] We sought refuge here

2
00:00:04,742 --> 00:00:06,676
thinking it was a safe haven.

3
00:00:08,383 --> 00:00:09,703
Our last safe haven,

4
00:00:11,484 --> 00:00:12,601
in a church.

5
00:00:14,055 --> 00:00:15,415
The house of God.

6
00:00:17,461 --> 00:00:18,564
Those are...

7
00:00:20,639 --> 00:00:22,159
My three children.

8
00:00:23,421 --> 00:00:27,241
I lost them...

9
00:00:29,023 --> 00:00:30,703
to the Israeli aggression

10
00:00:30,882 --> 00:00:32,155
against Gaza.

11
00:00:32,750 --> 00:00:35,190
During the air strike to the Church of Saint Porphyrius.

12
00:00:36,654 --> 00:00:39,475
Suhail Ramez El Soury,

13
00:00:41,281 --> 00:00:42,961
Jouly Ramez El Soury,

14
00:00:43,963 --> 00:00:45,716
Majd Ramez El Soury.

15
00:00:47,902 --> 00:00:51,773
This is the place that was bombed.

16
00:00:55,215 --> 00:00:57,741
Man: It was an all-civilian place.

17
00:00:59,224 --> 00:01:02,089
It had nothing to do with the military.

18
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:08,074
This photo was taken during Palm Sunday.

19
00:01:08,803 --> 00:01:10,045
This is Majd,

20
00:01:10,303 --> 00:01:12,029
my little bird.

21
00:01:12,631 --> 00:01:13,639
Look at him.

22
00:01:13,812 --> 00:01:14,932
He was a child.

23
00:01:16,718 --> 00:01:18,457
He became disfigured.

24
00:01:18,700 --> 00:01:21,848
He became dead and disfigured.

25
00:01:23,053 --> 00:01:25,283
His stomach was burned and had shrapnel.

26
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:27,538
My daughter Sima as well.

27
00:01:29,405 --> 00:01:31,085
Her head was crushed.

28
00:01:32,446 --> 00:01:34,112
She was disfigured. My daughter Sima.

29
00:01:37,987 --> 00:01:40,120
I myself

30
00:01:40,331 --> 00:01:41,931
pulled Suhail's body

31
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:44,800
from the rubble.

32
00:01:45,070 --> 00:01:46,467
He was hit

33
00:01:47,789 --> 00:01:49,453
in his head and feet,

34
00:01:50,167 --> 00:01:51,167
which were...

35
00:01:52,378 --> 00:01:53,578
almost cut off.

36
00:01:56,135 --> 00:01:59,001
Sima is now a beautiful bride next to God.

37
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:00,975
She is...

38
00:02:01,632 --> 00:02:02,992
She was an angel.

39
00:02:06,459 --> 00:02:07,459
An angel.

40
00:02:09,001 --> 00:02:10,164
She is an angel.

41
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:12,600
She is an angel.

42
00:02:12,891 --> 00:02:15,744
Do they bomb angels?

43
00:02:17,426 --> 00:02:20,320
They bombed my angels

44
00:02:21,523 --> 00:02:23,723
and killed them without warning.

45
00:02:23,793 --> 00:02:25,702
They killed our children,

46
00:02:25,921 --> 00:02:28,521
the children of cousins and relatives.

47
00:02:35,436 --> 00:02:38,352
[Crying]

48
00:02:56,547 --> 00:02:58,929
This is what they targeted.

49
00:02:59,172 --> 00:03:00,852
This was our shelter.

50
00:03:01,354 --> 00:03:02,954
This was our church.

51
00:03:04,646 --> 00:03:06,069
This was the entrance.

52
00:03:06,563 --> 00:03:08,484
We used to enter from here

53
00:03:08,883 --> 00:03:10,816
to pray to celebrate our joy.

54
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:18,265
Woman: Stay Strong.

55
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:21,653
Man: They took my children from me.
