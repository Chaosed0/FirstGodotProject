1
00:00:00,722 --> 00:00:04,849
We can't take it anymore, we're exhausted.

2
00:00:05,032 --> 00:00:07,976
Here, we become martyred victims.

3
00:00:08,048 --> 00:00:09,648
In a matter of time,

4
00:00:10,074 --> 00:00:12,736
we are going one after another.

5
00:00:14,425 --> 00:00:15,818
No one is seeing us

6
00:00:15,843 --> 00:00:17,909
or the size of this catastrophe

7
00:00:17,931 --> 00:00:20,731
and the crime we are experiencing in Gaza.

8
00:00:24,147 --> 00:00:25,827
[Reporter on air crying]

9
00:00:30,098 --> 00:00:33,555
No international security at all,

10
00:00:33,857 --> 00:00:35,924
no immunity or anything at all,

11
00:00:36,324 --> 00:00:39,348
for these shields or these helmets.

12
00:00:39,419 --> 00:00:44,242
These are merely slogans that we wear and that is all.

13
00:00:44,267 --> 00:00:46,656
They don't protect any journalists at all.

14
00:00:46,912 --> 00:00:49,172
[Taking off press vest] These shields don't protect us

15
00:00:49,180 --> 00:00:50,860
they are merely slogans.

16
00:00:51,020 --> 00:00:53,064
[Taking off helmet] We are losing souls,

17
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:54,560
one after another.

18
00:00:56,638 --> 00:00:59,932
We are victims, directly on live television.

19
00:01:00,860 --> 00:01:03,526
We are losing souls one after the other,

20
00:01:03,681 --> 00:01:05,361
with complete immunity.

21
00:01:05,362 --> 00:01:08,262
We are martyred victims in a matter of time,

22
00:01:08,278 --> 00:01:10,811
we wait our turn, one after the other.

23
00:01:11,204 --> 00:01:14,259
Our colleague, Mohammed Abu Hatab was here,

24
00:01:14,482 --> 00:01:16,122
just half an hour ago

25
00:01:16,163 --> 00:01:17,843
and now he has left us.

26
00:01:18,047 --> 00:01:20,126
Along with his wife, and son, and brother

27
00:01:20,187 --> 00:01:22,452
and many other victims from his family,

28
00:01:22,492 --> 00:01:24,172
here inside the hospital.
