00:00:00,643 --> 00:00:02,166
[i]CNN anchor Wolf Blitzer:[/i] Back down to our breaking news

2
00:00:02,229 --> 00:00:03,174
here in the middle east.

3
00:00:03,230 --> 00:00:04,642
A massive explosion

4
00:00:04,722 --> 00:00:06,522
at the largest refugee camp

5
00:00:06,769 --> 00:00:07,769
in Gaza.

6
00:00:07,923 --> 00:00:10,086
Joining us now is Lieutenant Colonel Richard Hecht.

7
00:00:10,330 --> 00:00:12,242
He is the international spokesperson

8
00:00:12,284 --> 00:00:14,284
for the Israel Defense Forces.

9
00:00:14,368 --> 00:00:15,670
Thanks so much for joining us.

10
00:00:15,713 --> 00:00:17,393
I wanna ask you first about this

11
00:00:17,422 --> 00:00:18,462
massive blast

12
00:00:18,636 --> 00:00:20,660
that we all just saw - we saw the video -

13
00:00:20,683 --> 00:00:22,944
at the Jabaliya refugee camp in Gaza.

14
00:00:23,411 --> 00:00:24,440
Is there anything more you can,

15
00:00:24,527 --> 00:00:25,673
first of all, tell us

16
00:00:25,721 --> 00:00:27,443
about how this explosion happened?

17
00:00:29,636 --> 00:00:31,716
[i]Richard:[/i] Hi Wolf, thanks for having me. So,

18
00:00:31,731 --> 00:00:33,509
We'll be coming out, in the next,

19
00:00:33,518 --> 00:00:34,549
hopefully, hour,

20
00:00:34,645 --> 00:00:36,762
with more data, but I can update you

21
00:00:37,034 --> 00:00:39,167
now that there was a very senior

22
00:00:39,495 --> 00:00:41,781
Hamas commander in that area,

23
00:00:42,319 --> 00:00:44,569
sadly he was hiding, again,

24
00:00:44,664 --> 00:00:45,664
as they do,

25
00:00:45,988 --> 00:00:48,456
behind, eh, behind civilians,

26
00:00:48,936 --> 00:00:50,269
and that's all I can say at this point.

27
00:00:50,328 --> 00:00:51,500
We'll be looking into it and we'll be

28
00:00:51,525 --> 00:00:54,520
coming out with more data as we learn what happened here.

29
00:00:56,069 --> 00:00:58,656
[i]Wolf:[/i] So can you confirm it was an Israeli attack

30
00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:00,417
that- that destroyed a big chunk

31
00:01:00,445 --> 00:01:02,445
of that Jabaliya refugee camp?

32
00:01:04,880 --> 00:01:06,400
[i]Richard:[/i] Yes I can.

33
00:01:07,183 --> 00:01:10,620
We were focused again on the target, a senior -

34
00:01:12,196 --> 00:01:13,876
a senior commander, Wolf,

35
00:01:13,947 --> 00:01:15,882
and we'll be updating you

36
00:01:16,286 --> 00:01:18,886
with more data as the hour moves ahead.

37
00:01:21,034 --> 00:01:23,764
[i]Wolf:[/i] But even if that, uh, Hamas commander

38
00:01:23,850 --> 00:01:26,611
was there admist all those Palestinian refugees

39
00:01:26,735 --> 00:01:29,464
who were in that Jabaliya refugee camp

40
00:01:29,890 --> 00:01:32,668
Israel still went ahead and dropped a bomb there,

41
00:01:32,753 --> 00:01:37,079
attempting to kill this Hamas commander,

42
00:01:37,373 --> 00:01:39,711
knowing that a lot of innocent civilians -

43
00:01:39,817 --> 00:01:41,135
men, women, and children -

44
00:01:41,204 --> 00:01:44,724
presumably, would be killed - is that what I'm hearing?

45
00:01:45,886 --> 00:01:47,384
[i]Richard:[/i] That's not what you're hearing, Wolf.

46
00:01:47,413 --> 00:01:50,213
We, again, were focused on this commander.

47
00:01:50,398 --> 00:01:53,191
again, you'll get more data on who this man was,

48
00:01:53,276 --> 00:01:55,076
killed many, many Israelis,

49
00:01:55,769 --> 00:01:59,022
we're doing everything we can, this is a very complicated

50
00:01:59,302 --> 00:02:01,978
battle space. There could be infrastructure there.

51
00:02:01,979 --> 00:02:03,595
There could be tunnels there.

52
00:02:03,944 --> 00:02:04,904
We're still looking into it

53
00:02:04,976 --> 00:02:08,368
and we'll give you more data as the hour moves ahead.

54
00:02:09,050 --> 00:02:11,088
[i]Wolf:[/i] But you know that there are a lot of refugees -

55
00:02:11,113 --> 00:02:12,722
a lot of innocent civilians -

56
00:02:12,922 --> 00:02:14,044
men, women, and children -

57
00:02:14,062 --> 00:02:16,462
in that refugee camp as well, right?

58
00:02:17,895 --> 00:02:20,331
[i]Richard:[/i] This is the tragedy of war, Wolf.

59
00:02:20,755 --> 00:02:22,555
As you know, we've been saying for days.

60
00:02:22,635 --> 00:02:23,635
Move south.

61
00:02:24,043 --> 00:02:25,995
Civilians who are not involved with Hamas,

62
00:02:26,035 --> 00:02:27,475
please move south.

63
00:02:27,839 --> 00:02:28,529
We, uh -

64
00:02:28,562 --> 00:02:30,355
[i]Wolf:[/i] Just trying to get a little more information.

65
00:02:30,406 --> 00:02:31,835
You knew there were civilians there.

66
00:02:31,867 --> 00:02:33,260
You knew there were refugees.

67
00:02:33,356 --> 00:02:34,736
All sorts of refugees.

68
00:02:34,797 --> 00:02:37,197
But you decided to still drop a bomb

69
00:02:37,294 --> 00:02:39,008
on that refugee camp, attempting

70
00:02:39,123 --> 00:02:40,519
to kill this Hamas commander -

71
00:02:40,636 --> 00:02:42,369
by the way, was he killed?

72
00:02:44,102 --> 00:02:46,907
[i]Richard:[/i] I can't confirm yet, there'll be more, uh, updated -

73
00:02:46,995 --> 00:02:49,062
he, yes, we know that he was killed.

74
00:02:50,691 --> 00:02:52,013
About the civilians there,

75
00:02:52,047 --> 00:02:53,819
we're doing everything we can to minimize.

76
00:02:53,889 --> 00:02:55,436
I'll say it again:

77
00:02:55,848 --> 00:02:58,515
sadly, they are hiding themselves within

78
00:02:59,210 --> 00:03:00,344
civilian populations.

79
00:03:00,405 --> 00:03:02,460
And again, we're doing this stage by stage,

80
00:03:02,579 --> 00:03:05,484
and we're gonna go after every one of these terrorists

81
00:03:05,937 --> 00:03:10,079
involved on that henious attack on the 7th of October, Wolf.
