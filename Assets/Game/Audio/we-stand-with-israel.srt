1
00:00:01,032 --> 00:00:03,032
 This was an act of sheer evil.

2
00:00:04,389 --> 00:00:06,992
More than one thousand civilians slaughtered.

3
00:00:07,484 --> 00:00:08,738
Not just killed - slaughtered.

4
00:00:09,476 --> 00:00:10,491
In Israel.

5
00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:15,093
Among them, at least fourteen American citizens killed.

6
00:00:16,536 --> 00:00:20,155
Parents butchered using their bodies to try to protect their children.

7
00:00:21,388 --> 00:00:24,509
Stomach-turning reports of being — babies being killed.

8
00:00:25,412 --> 00:00:27,305
Entire families slain.

9
00:00:27,987 --> 00:00:32,073
Young people massacred while attending a musical festival to celebrate peace -

10
00:00:32,624 --> 00:00:34,304
to celebrate peace.

11
00:00:34,979 --> 00:00:37,654
Women raped, assaulted, paraded as trophies.

12
00:00:38,775 --> 00:00:39,775
Families...

13
00:00:40,552 --> 00:00:42,870
 hid their fear for hours and hours

14
00:00:42,894 --> 00:00:44,895
desperately trying to keep their children quiet

15
00:00:45,967 --> 00:00:47,442
to avoid drawing attention.

16
00:00:49,328 --> 00:00:51,008
And thousands of wounded,

17
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:55,772
alive but carrying with them the bullet holes, the shrapnel wounds, and the memory

18
00:00:56,290 --> 00:00:57,970
of what they endured.

19
00:00:58,957 --> 00:01:01,639
You all know these traumas never go away.

20
00:01:02,263 --> 00:01:06,644
There are still so many families desperately waiting to hear the fate of their loved ones,

21
00:01:06,966 --> 00:01:10,688
not knowing if they’re alive or dead or hostages.

22
00:01:11,283 --> 00:01:14,171
Infants in their mothers’ arms, grandparents in wheelchairs,

23
00:01:14,196 --> 00:01:17,843
 Holocaust survivors abducted and held hostage -

24
00:01:18,708 --> 00:01:22,022
hostages whom Hamas has now threatened to execute

25
00:01:22,347 --> 00:01:25,248
in violation of every code of human morality.

26
00:01:26,523 --> 00:01:27,723
It’s abhorrent.

27
00:01:28,833 --> 00:01:30,513
The brutality of Hamas -

28
00:01:31,311 --> 00:01:33,323
this bloodthirstiness -

29
00:01:33,554 --> 00:01:38,077
rings to mind the worst — the worst rampages of ISIS.

30
00:01:39,050 --> 00:01:40,490
This is terrorism.

31
00:01:41,373 --> 00:01:45,000
But sadly, for the Jewish people, it’s not new.

32
00:01:46,205 --> 00:01:49,282
This attack has brought to the surface painful memories

33
00:01:49,910 --> 00:01:56,248
 and the scars left by a millennia of antisemitism and genocide of the Jewish people.

34
00:01:58,705 --> 00:02:00,031
So, in this moment,

35
00:02:00,944 --> 00:02:02,674
we must be crystal clear:

36
00:02:02,952 --> 00:02:05,507
We stand with Israel.

37
00:02:06,421 --> 00:02:08,698
We stand with Israel.
