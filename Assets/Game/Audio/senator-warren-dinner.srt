1
00:00:00,158 --> 00:00:02,873
Senator Warren? Um, hi

2
00:00:03,183 --> 00:00:06,383
I'm a refugee from Gaza and a constituent of yours

3
00:00:06,897 --> 00:00:08,577
Warren: I'm having dinner.

4
00:00:09,752 --> 00:00:12,086
68 members of my family were killed

5
00:00:12,103 --> 00:00:13,387
over the last three weeks

6
00:00:13,467 --> 00:00:15,160
and I just want to know how many more have to die

7
00:00:15,175 --> 00:00:16,915
before you're going to call for a ceasefire?

8
00:00:16,976 --> 00:00:19,960
I don't know, what more do you want me to tell you?

9
00:00:20,044 --> 00:00:21,574
I mean, what do I have to do?

10
00:00:21,646 --> 00:00:22,925
How many more of my family has to die

11
00:00:22,933 --> 00:00:24,426
for you to call for a ceasefire?

12
00:00:24,467 --> 00:00:25,663
I just don't know,

13
00:00:25,711 --> 00:00:27,301
how much more do I have to say

14
00:00:27,349 --> 00:00:28,555
for you to call for a ceasefire?

15
00:00:28,571 --> 00:00:29,738
People are calling your office every day

16
00:00:29,754 --> 00:00:31,111
asking for a ceasefire, and

17
00:00:31,136 --> 00:00:33,063
you are refusing to call for a ceasefire

18
00:00:33,095 --> 00:00:37,191
Man: I don't think this is the proper place for this -
