1
00:00:00,484 --> 00:00:02,417
Since the seventh of October,

2
00:00:02,476 --> 00:00:04,156
we face extermination,

3
00:00:04,340 --> 00:00:05,340
killing,

4
00:00:05,468 --> 00:00:07,785
bombing falling over our heads,

5
00:00:08,203 --> 00:00:09,203
all -

6
00:00:09,595 --> 00:00:12,691
all of this in front of the world.

7
00:00:12,926 --> 00:00:15,326
They lie to the world that they kill [?]

8
00:00:15,935 --> 00:00:16,935
but they

9
00:00:17,020 --> 00:00:18,700
kill the people of Gaza,

10
00:00:18,991 --> 00:00:21,189
their dreams and their future.

11
00:00:21,327 --> 00:00:24,620
Kids of Gaza run out of their [?]

12
00:00:25,117 --> 00:00:26,770
We come to Al-Shifa hospital

13
00:00:26,794 --> 00:00:28,552
to keep us from bombing.

14
00:00:28,700 --> 00:00:30,567
We suddenly run out of [into?] more.

15
00:00:31,267 --> 00:00:33,817
After bombing the hospital,

16
00:00:34,130 --> 00:00:36,130
the occupation is starving us.

17
00:00:36,317 --> 00:00:39,405
We don't find water, food,

18
00:00:39,722 --> 00:00:42,189
and we drink from the unusable water.

19
00:00:42,593 --> 00:00:45,022
We come now to shout,

20
00:00:45,471 --> 00:00:47,755
and invite you to protect us.

21
00:00:48,594 --> 00:00:50,661
We want to live! We want peace!

22
00:00:50,685 --> 00:00:55,007
We want to [?] have shelter!

23
00:00:55,151 --> 00:00:57,960
We want medicine, food, and education!

24
00:00:58,278 --> 00:01:02,769
And we want to live as the other children live.
