1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,111
[i]Fadi Abu Shamallah:[/i] I start from, from the heavy airstrike

2
00:00:04,131 --> 00:00:06,731
and the shelling over all of Gaza Strip

3
00:00:06,842 --> 00:00:09,742
every single minute that we have been bombed.

4
00:00:10,236 --> 00:00:11,692
The numbers talked about,

5
00:00:11,708 --> 00:00:17,333
10,000 rockets have been launched over Gaza Strip.

6
00:00:17,381 --> 00:00:21,359
More than 12,000

7
00:00:21,383 --> 00:00:23,783
of civilian people have been killed.

8
00:00:24,948 --> 00:00:27,348
Hundreds of people, civilian people,

9
00:00:27,424 --> 00:00:29,846
are still under rubbles,

10
00:00:29,894 --> 00:00:31,094
and [inaudible]

11
00:00:31,872 --> 00:00:34,462
are not able to rescue them

12
00:00:35,034 --> 00:00:38,902
and pull them out from under the rubbles.

13
00:00:39,015 --> 00:00:41,410
Or should I talk about the

14
00:00:41,728 --> 00:00:46,350
entire neighborhoods that’s flattened,

15
00:00:46,390 --> 00:00:48,434
the road that is cut off,

16
00:00:51,371 --> 00:00:52,371
the water,

17
00:00:52,417 --> 00:00:53,951
the severe shortage of water,

18
00:00:54,023 --> 00:00:56,289
the severe shortage of food, fuel?

19
00:00:56,880 --> 00:00:58,345
We don’t have electricity

20
00:00:58,369 --> 00:01:02,052
for more than 20 days now or more.

21
00:01:04,416 --> 00:01:06,431
I don’t know, to talk about the UNRWA shelters,

22
00:01:06,463 --> 00:01:08,330
that it has around more than

23
00:01:08,401 --> 00:01:10,601
half-million of displaced people.

24
00:01:11,044 --> 00:01:14,628
Israel asked us to evacuate

25
00:01:15,411 --> 00:01:18,458
the Gaza City and the north,

26
00:01:19,176 --> 00:01:20,258
because in there -

27
00:01:20,282 --> 00:01:22,616
and they killed, they assassinated,

28
00:01:22,859 --> 00:01:24,993
they targeted the convoy of cars

29
00:01:25,077 --> 00:01:27,732
while they were traveling

30
00:01:27,828 --> 00:01:30,493
and evacuating to the south of Gaza Strip.

31
00:01:30,542 --> 00:01:32,830
Should I talk about the live video

32
00:01:32,846 --> 00:01:34,618
that’s recorded by

33
00:01:34,833 --> 00:01:36,736
and broadcasted by a journalist,

34
00:01:36,752 --> 00:01:38,347
Palestinian local journalist?

35
00:01:38,387 --> 00:01:39,736
His name is Hassan Saifi.

36
00:01:39,792 --> 00:01:41,958
He filmed and recorded a video

37
00:01:42,022 --> 00:01:46,103
while the tank launched and bombed a civilian car

38
00:01:46,106 --> 00:01:48,547
while they were evacuating

39
00:01:48,952 --> 00:01:50,174
to the south.

40
00:01:50,349 --> 00:01:51,214
What should I talk about?

41
00:01:51,246 --> 00:01:52,547
That we don’t have bread?

42
00:01:52,651 --> 00:01:54,331
That we don’t have water?

43
00:01:54,452 --> 00:01:55,682
We don’t have fuel.

44
00:01:55,833 --> 00:01:56,833
Nothing.

45
00:01:57,159 --> 00:01:59,174
We have only one thing:

46
00:01:59,381 --> 00:02:00,656
that we are being killed.

47
00:02:00,768 --> 00:02:01,529
There is -

48
00:02:01,538 --> 00:02:02,243
and, of course,

49
00:02:02,268 --> 00:02:05,596
with a green light with the international community,

50
00:02:05,617 --> 00:02:07,617
with the U.S. administration.

51
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:09,172
This is the situation.

52
00:02:09,228 --> 00:02:10,513
People are scared.

53
00:02:10,553 --> 00:02:12,420
From what? For being killed.

54
00:02:13,061 --> 00:02:15,768
Really, we are having now

55
00:02:16,136 --> 00:02:18,216
a second Nakba, if you know it.

56
00:02:18,601 --> 00:02:20,668
The first one happened in 1948.

57
00:02:21,032 --> 00:02:22,624
We feel that it’s another Nakba

58
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:23,886
that we are going through,

59
00:02:23,934 --> 00:02:25,294
to go through it.

60
00:02:26,389 --> 00:02:29,674
The most horrible thing for us,

61
00:02:29,952 --> 00:02:30,977
that’s the officials.

62
00:02:30,985 --> 00:02:32,719
The Israeli officials say

63
00:02:34,008 --> 00:02:37,100
that we are human animals.

64
00:02:37,124 --> 00:02:39,057
Human animals? Animal humans?

65
00:02:39,074 --> 00:02:40,437
I don’t remember exactly.

66
00:02:40,493 --> 00:02:43,593
Like, we are treated like animals.

67
00:02:44,285 --> 00:02:47,364
You know what happen to animals?

68
00:02:47,476 --> 00:02:49,076
They’re slaughtered.

69
00:02:49,952 --> 00:02:52,351
So, we are slaughtered now

70
00:02:52,636 --> 00:02:54,737
by the Israeli genocide government.

71
00:02:54,769 --> 00:02:57,333
This is what’s happening now.

72
00:02:57,413 --> 00:03:03,908
Like, they now [inaudible].

73
00:03:04,606 --> 00:03:06,606
This is what is going on here,

74
00:03:06,675 --> 00:03:07,675
a genocide.

75
00:03:08,052 --> 00:03:09,868
A real genocide and massacre

76
00:03:09,909 --> 00:03:11,269
is happening now.

77
00:03:11,309 --> 00:03:13,452
Like, in previous wars, we used to have

78
00:03:13,651 --> 00:03:15,733
like 10 persons of a family is killed.

79
00:03:15,813 --> 00:03:16,813
Now,

80
00:03:16,852 --> 00:03:17,637
the whole building,

81
00:03:17,681 --> 00:03:20,014
the entire neighborhoods is bombed,

82
00:03:20,230 --> 00:03:21,230
flattened.

83
00:03:21,277 --> 00:03:24,704
It’s happening in Jabaliya for three days,

84
00:03:24,943 --> 00:03:25,943
in Nuseirat,

85
00:03:27,115 --> 00:03:28,343
in Khan Younis city,

86
00:03:28,390 --> 00:03:31,835
in every single mid-Gaza Strip cities.

87
00:03:31,946 --> 00:03:33,668
This is what is happening here now.

88
00:03:34,256 --> 00:03:35,208
I’m a father of three kids,

89
00:03:35,233 --> 00:03:36,216
as you have mentioned.

90
00:03:36,549 --> 00:03:37,875
They think that I’m a hero.

91
00:03:37,870 --> 00:03:38,501
I’m not.

92
00:03:38,526 --> 00:03:40,459
I’m scared exactly like them.
