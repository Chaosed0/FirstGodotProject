[i]Democracy Now news anchor:[/i] Why don't

2
00:00:01,246 --> 00:00:03,444
you go with your family south?

3
00:00:04,016 --> 00:00:05,309
[i]Dr Hammam Alloh:[/i] And if I go,

4
00:00:05,374 --> 00:00:07,054
who treats my patients?

5
00:00:07,802 --> 00:00:09,015
We are not animals.

6
00:00:09,037 --> 00:00:10,037
We have...

7
00:00:10,046 --> 00:00:11,646
the right to receive

8
00:00:12,075 --> 00:00:13,352
proper healthcare.

9
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:15,142
You think I went to medical school

10
00:00:15,167 --> 00:00:17,257
and for my postgraduate degrees

11
00:00:18,233 --> 00:00:19,913
for a total of 14 years

12
00:00:20,144 --> 00:00:22,078
so I think only about my life

13
00:00:22,478 --> 00:00:24,078
and not my patients?

14
00:00:25,186 --> 00:00:26,866
I'm asking you, ma'am.

15
00:00:27,198 --> 00:00:28,857
Do you think this is the reason

16
00:00:28,873 --> 00:00:30,230
I went to med school,

17
00:00:30,270 --> 00:00:32,137
to think only about my life?

18
00:00:34,429 --> 00:00:35,714
This is not the reason why

19
00:00:35,746 --> 00:00:37,186
I became a doctor.
